# RPM MetaData

This repository contains the various schema files for the RPM MetaData (rpm-md) format
created originally for the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) and supported by a large number
of RPM package managers.

Currently, there is no reference files for this, so this repository contains a collection of
schema files from various sources, which will hopefully be used to create a rationalized,
uniform definition of what the metadata format actually is.
